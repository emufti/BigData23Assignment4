# Assignment 4: Neo4j and Gephi
For this assignment, you will work with a social graph extracted from the social aggregator platform reddit (www.reddit.com), relating to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Your task for this assignment is to use Neo4j and Gephi to perform an analysis on this data set.

For this assignment, you are basically free to explore anything you deem interesting, and present your findings in your report. The main goal is to get familiar with Neo4j and Gephi, but also to hone your "storytelling" skills. In that sense, try to focus on a single or a few hypotheses or findings you explore in full (with nicely formatted visualizations) and explaining what it says instead of just going for quick filter saying: "here are the three nodes with the most connections" (boring).

See "Assignment 4.pdf" for more instructions and steps to set up Neo4j.
